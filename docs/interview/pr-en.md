Nice to meet you, my name is Mercury Wang. After transitioning to IT development in 2018, I have about 6 years experience in development. The major technologies that I have been using are JavaScript/TypeScript, React, CSS, and HTML. Meanwhile I also have around 2 years of experience with SQL and Java.

I've started to work in Japan since October 2022. It's been a year and a half now. During this time, I've been studying Japanese on my own. I don't have any problems with reading and writing documents, while I'm still working hard on my conversational skills.

In Japan, I've been involved in 3 projects so far, all of which have been in front-end development.

From October 2023 until now, I've been responsible for developing a management system for construction operations. The core technologies are TypeScript, Less, and React. My responsibilities include handling common components and business modules.

From April to September 2023, I developed a weekly reporting system for a factory. Again, the core technologies were TypeScript and React. I was responsible for modules such as weekly report creation, editing, saving, and searching.

From October 2022 to March 2023, I developed an order system for fire and earthquake insurance. For this project, I was responsible for developing the form pages of the insurance order system.
