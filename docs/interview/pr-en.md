## Self Introduction

Nice to meet you, my name is Ziyu Wang.

After transitioning to IT development in 2018, I have more than six years of experience in software development. The primary technologies I have been using include JavaScript/TypeScript, React, CSS, and HTML. Additionally, I have about two years of experience with SQL and Java.

I began working in Japan in October 2022, and it has been a year and a half since then. During this time, I've been studying Japanese on my own. I don't have much problems with reading and writing documents, while I'm still working hard on my conversational skills.

In Japan, I have participated in three projects so far, all of which have focused on front-end development.

From October 2023 until now, I have been responsible for developing a management system for construction operations. The core technologies used are TypeScript, Less, and React. My responsibilities include handling common components and business modules.

From April to September 2023, I had developed a weekly reporting system. Once again, the core technologies were TypeScript and React. I was responsible for modules such as weekly report creation, editing, saving, and searching.

From October 2022 to March 2023, I participated in an order system for fire and earthquake insurance. For this project, I was responsible for developing the form pages of the insurance order system. Fire and earthquake insurance are types of home insurance, which are common in non-life insurance.

## Data Analysis

- In my first job in the IT industry, I gained over two years of experience in data analysis and development of visualization tools.

- At that time, I worked for a company focused on developing BI platform software targeting Tableau. We implemented a system which contains the features or say an operating flow as:

1. **Data Connection**: which is to connect to a wide range of data sources, including databases, spreadsheets, allowing users to analyze data from various sources in one platform.

2. **Visualizations**: to offer a wide variety of visualization options, including bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, maps, and more. Users can customize these visualizations to suit their needs and create dynamic, interactive dashboards.

3. **Dashboards**: allows users to combine multiple visualizations into interactive dashboards, providing a comprehensive view of their data.

4. **Data Analysis**: allows users to perform advanced data analysis and create reports based on their data.
