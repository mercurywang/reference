Nice to meet you, my name is Mercury Wang. After transitioning to IT development in 2018, I have about 6 years experience in development. The major technologies that I have been using are JavaScript/TypeScript, React, CSS, and HTML. Meanwhile I also have around 2 years of experience with SQL and Java.

I've started to work in Japan since October 2022. It's been a year and a half now. During this time, I've been studying Japanese on my own. I don't have any problems with reading and writing documents, while I'm still working hard on my conversational skills.

In Japan, I've been involved in 3 projects so far, all of which have been in front-end development.

From October 2023 until now, I've been responsible for developing a management system for construction operations. The core technologies are TypeScript, Less, and React. My responsibilities include handling common components and business modules.

From April to September 2023, I developed a weekly reporting system for a factory. Again, the core technologies were TypeScript and React. I was responsible for modules such as weekly report creation, editing, saving, and searching.

From October 2022 to March 2023, I developed an order system for fire and earthquake insurance. For this project, I was responsible for developing the form pages of the insurance order system.

During the integration testing phase, I was involved in testing the entire business process, including the product list, product search, order page, order preview, order success page, and more.

I participated in the QA process, which involved querying and confirming specifications related to uncertain areas of business logic, designing documents, and defining standards.

- Before transitioning into the IT industry, I had about two years of work experience primarily focused on international health insurance services and insurance claims.

- Foreigners working in China are typically provided with commercial medical insurance by their companies. The benefit of doing so is that they can receive insurance reimbursement when seeking medical treatment at international medical centers and hospitals where English services are available.

- The company I worked for was responsible for assisting foreigners with medical services and handling insurance claims and reimbursement thereafter.

- Recommend hospitals as per symptoms.
- After seeing a doctor, make claim and reimbursement according to the diagnosis and insurance policy.
- What percentage is covered by insurance?
- What is the maximum amount of insurance coverage?
- What is the maximum amount of insurance coverage?
