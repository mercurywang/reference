## Self Introduction

Nice to meet you, my name is Ziyu Wang.

After transitioning to IT development in 2018, I have more than six years of experience in software development. The primary technologies I have been using include JavaScript/TypeScript, React, CSS, and HTML. Additionally, I have about two years of experience with SQL and Java.

I began working in Japan in October 2022, and it has been a year and a half since then. During this time, I've been studying Japanese on my own. My Japanese level now is ranging between N4 and N3.

In Japan, I have participated in three projects so far, all of which have focused on front-end development.

## Other Positions

I have also looked into other engineering positions from the link that you shared with me earlier, and I've found that the Guidewire Engineer role suits me the best because of my experience in the insurance industry.

## Questions

1. Since the job position is Guidewire Engineer. Where is the work location?
2. Is English the primary language used in the workplace?
3. Is English the primary communicating language during Interview?
4. Could you please provide a brief overview of your company's interview process? Like how many rounds and whether is it a face to face interview or online interview?
5. How long will the entire interview process take?

## One more thing

There is one more thing: I have been working in the current project for the client company for almost a year. And the client company has applied to my current company, requesting that I start directly with their company from April onwards. And my current company agreed on that request.

Would you accept me working at a new company for a month before joining your company?

## Insurance Experiences

Before transitioning into the IT industry, I had about one year of work experience primarily focused on international health insurance services and insurance claims from 2011 to 2012.

Foreigners working in China are typically provided with commercial medical insurance. The benefit of this is that insured can receive insurance reimbursement when seeking medical treatment at international medical centers and hospitals where English services are provided.

The company I worked for was responsible for assisting foreign clients with medical services, providing direct billing, and handling insurance claims and reimbursements thereafter. Direct billing refers to real-time reimbursement for outpatient services. The core techniques involve the real-time billing network system, membership cards(Anti-counterfeiting technology), and terminal machines. During that time, I was the one who was using the system. Now, I hope to have the opportunity to develop a system in that capacity.

- Recommend hospitals as per symptoms.
- After seeing a doctor, make claim and reimbursement according to the diagnosis and insurance policy.
- What percentage is covered by insurance?
- What is the maximum amount of insurance coverage?
- What is the minimum amount of insurance coverage?
